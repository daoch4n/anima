# Feature: Emotion Detection for Live2D Character

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for adding emotion detection capabilities to Gemini-chan by analyzing conversation transcripts and applying appropriate facial expressions and animations to the Live2D character. This system enhances the character's expressiveness by responding to emotional context in conversations.

## 2. Epics

### 2.1. Epic: Emotion Detection and Expression
This epic covers the core functionality for detecting emotions in conversations and expressing them through the Live2D character.

#### 2.1.1. User Story: Emotion-Based Character Expressions
- **Priority**: High
- **As a** user,
- **I want** the Live2D character to show appropriate emotions based on conversation context,
- **so that** interactions feel more natural and emotionally engaging.

##### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: Character shows happy expression for positive sentiment
  Given a conversation contains positive sentiment
  When the emotion detection system processes the transcript
  Then the character SHALL display happy or cheerful expressions

Scenario: Character shows concerned expression for negative sentiment
  Given a conversation contains negative sentiment
  When the emotion detection system processes the transcript
  Then the character SHALL show concerned or sympathetic expressions

Scenario: Character maintains neutral expression for neutral conversation
  Given a conversation is neutral
  When the emotion detection system processes the transcript
  Then the character SHALL maintain a pleasant default expression

Scenario: Character transitions smoothly between emotions
  Given emotions change during conversation
  When the emotion detection system processes the changes
  Then the character SHALL transition smoothly between expressions
```

#### 2.1.2. User Story: Real-Time Emotion Detection
- **Priority**: High
- **As a** user,
- **I want** emotion detection to work in real-time,
- **so that** character expressions stay synchronized with the conversation flow.

##### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: Emotion analysis completes within time threshold
  Given new speech is detected
  When emotion analysis begins
  Then analysis SHALL complete within 2 seconds

Scenario: Character expressions update promptly
  Given emotions are detected
  When the system processes the emotions
  Then character expressions SHALL update within 500ms

Scenario: System prioritizes strongest emotion
  Given multiple emotions are present
  When the system analyzes the emotions
  Then the system SHALL prioritize the strongest emotion

Scenario: System handles rapid emotion changes gracefully
  Given conversation pace is fast
  When multiple emotion changes occur rapidly
  Then the system SHALL handle rapid emotion changes gracefully
```

#### 2.1.3. User Story: Optional Emotion Detection
- **Priority**: Medium
- **As a** user,
- **I want** emotion detection to be optional,
- **so that** I can disable it if I prefer simpler character behavior.

##### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: User can enable/disable emotion detection
  Given the user accesses settings
  When they view emotion detection options
  Then the user SHALL be able to enable/disable emotion detection

Scenario: Character uses basic animations when disabled
  Given emotion detection is disabled
  When the character operates
  Then the character SHALL use only basic audio-responsive animations

Scenario: Character shows enhanced expressiveness when enabled
  Given emotion detection is enabled
  When the character operates
  Then the user SHALL see enhanced character expressiveness

Scenario: Smooth transition when switching modes
  Given the user switches emotion detection modes
  When the system applies the change
  Then the transition SHALL be smooth without requiring app restart
