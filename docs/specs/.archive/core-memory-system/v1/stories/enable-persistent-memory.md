# User Stories for Epic: Enable Persistent Memory

This document breaks down the high-level epic for Gemini-chan's memory system into smaller, actionable user stories. Each story represents a distinct piece of value that moves us closer to the goal of a more personalized and continuous user experience. The successful implementation of these stories will transform the user's interaction from a series of disconnected sessions into an evolving, long-term relationship with their AI companion.


### **Parent Epic:**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to remember key details about me and our past conversations across different sessions, so that our interactions feel more personal, continuous, and meaningful.**


### **User Stories:**


#### **Story 1: Core Memory Storage**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to intelligently identify and save important, foundational pieces of information I share during our conversation, so that a durable and accurate memory of our relationship is built over time.**



* **Narrative:** This story is the bedrock of the memory system. It's about moving beyond simple chat history to create a structured "memory bank" of key facts. When a user shares something significant, like their name, a core interest, or a personal detail, they expect it to be remembered. This feature enables Gemini-chan to distinguish between conversational filler and meaningful data points that define the user's identity and preferences, forming the basis for all future personalized interactions.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. **Given** I tell Gemini-chan a key fact (e.g., "My name is Alex," "I have a pet dog named Sparky," or "I work as a software developer"), the system's natural language understanding (NLU) model must parse the statement and correctly identify it as a piece of information worth remembering.
    2. **When** a key fact is identified, it must be normalized and saved as a distinct entry in the vector store that is uniquely associated with my user session ID. The system should avoid storing duplicate facts; if I mention my name is Alex multiple times, it should update or reinforce the existing memory, not create a new one.
    3. **The** saved memory entry must be tagged with relevant metadata, including a precise timestamp, the specific conversation turn in which it was mentioned, and a confidence score indicating how certain the system is that this is a "fact" versus a passing comment.
    4. **The** system should be able to differentiate between permanent facts (like a name) and temporary states (like "I'm feeling tired today") to prioritize what gets stored in long-term memory.


#### **Story 2: Contextual Memory Retrieval**

**As a user, when I'm talking about a topic we've discussed before, I want Gemini-chan to seamlessly recall relevant memories and use them to inform her responses, so that the conversation feels intelligent, context-aware, and continuous.**



* **Narrative:** This story brings the memory to life. Itâ€™s not enough to just store data; Gemini-chan must be able to access and use it at the right moment. If a user mentions their dog, they want Gemini-chan to remember its name from a past conversation. This proactive retrieval makes the user feel listened to and understood, proving that their past interactions have had a lasting impact.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. **Given** Gemini-chan has a memory of my name ("Alex"), **when** I ask a direct question like "What is my name?", she must retrieve the correct information from the vector store and answer "Your name is Alex."
    2. **Given** we've talked about my hobby (e.g., "I love to go hiking on weekends"), **when** I later mention "I had a great time outdoors this weekend," her response should be contextually enriched by the retrieved memory (e.g., "That's great! Did you get to go hiking on one of your favorite trails?").
    3. **With** every new user input, the system must perform an efficient similarity search on the vector store to find the most relevant memories. These retrieved memories should then be passed to the language model as part of the prompt context.
    4. **The** retrieval must be subtle. Gemini-chan should not simply state the remembered fact but use it to guide the conversation naturally, avoiding responses like "My database indicates you like hiking."


#### **Story 3: Automatic Conversation Summarization**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to automatically create a concise summary of our conversation when it ends, so that the key points and emotional tone are preserved for future interactions without me having to repeat myself.**



* **Narrative:** Individual facts are useful, but the overall context of a conversation is just as important. This story ensures that the essence of an entire interaction is captured. If a user spends a session planning a trip, the summary should capture the destination and key activities. This allows the user to pick up right where they left off in the next session, creating a truly seamless, multi-session experience.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. **Given** a conversation session has been active for a meaningful duration (e.g., more than 5 exchanges or a session length exceeding 10 minutes), **when** the session ends (either through explicit user action like closing the tab or a period of inactivity), a summarization process must be automatically triggered.
    2. **The** generated summary must accurately capture the main topics, key decisions, and any significant personal information or emotional sentiment expressed during the conversation. For example, "User discussed their upcoming trip to Japan and expressed excitement about visiting Kyoto."
    3. **This** summary must be converted into a vector embedding and stored in the memory system, linked to the user's session and tagged as a "Conversation Summary" to differentiate it from individual facts.


#### **Story 4: User-Initiated Memory Review**

**As a user, I want to be able to ask Gemini-chan what she remembers about me in a clear and understandable way, so that I have full transparency and a sense of partnership in how my data is being used.**



* **Narrative:** Trust is crucial for a personal AI companion. This story empowers the user by giving them a window into Gemini-chan's memory. By allowing users to review what is being remembered, the system becomes less of a "black box" and more of a collaborative tool, fostering user confidence and reinforcing the idea that they are in control of their own digital footprint.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. **Given** I ask a direct question like, "What do you know about me?", "Summarize my profile," or "What have I told you before?", the system must initiate a query to the vector store to retrieve all memories associated with my user ID.
    2. **Gemini-chan** must not just list the raw data. She must synthesize the retrieved memories (both individual facts and conversation summaries) into a coherent, well-structured, and easy-to-understand natural-language summary.
    3. **The** response should be organized and conversational, for example: "From what I remember, your name is Alex, you have a dog named Sparky, and we recently talked about your passion for hiking. We also had a longer chat about your travel plans for Japan."
    4. **If** no memories have been stored for the user, Gemini-chan should respond gracefully, saying something like, "We're just getting to know each other, so I don't have any memories stored for you yet. I'm looking forward to learning more about you!"


#### **Story 5: User-Initiated Memory Deletion**

**As a user, I want to be able to tell Gemini-chan to forget a specific piece of information or all of her memories about me, so that I have complete and granular control over my privacy and personal data.**



* **Narrative:** Ultimate control over personal data is non-negotiable. This story provides the user with an essential "off-switch." Whether they shared something they regret, want to start fresh, or simply wish to erase their history for privacy reasons, this feature ensures they can do so easily and effectively. It is a critical component for building long-term user trust.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. **Given** I issue a specific command like, "Forget my name," or "Forget what I told you about my dog," the system must identify the corresponding memory entry (or entries) in the vector store and permanently remove it.
    2. **Given** I issue a global command like, "Forget everything you know about me," or "Clear your memory," the system must delete all memories and conversation summaries associated with my user session from the vector store.
    3. **Before** executing a global deletion, Gemini-chan must ask for confirmation to prevent accidental data loss, for instance, "Are you sure you want me to forget everything we've talked about? This action cannot be undone."
    4. **After** a memory is successfully deleted, Gemini-chan must provide a confirmation message (e.g., "Okay, I've forgotten that information."). Subsequent attempts to recall the deleted information must fail, as if it were never shared in the first place.
