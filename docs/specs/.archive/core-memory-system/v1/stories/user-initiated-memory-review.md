# User Story: User-Initiated Memory Review

This document outlines the user story for the fourth phase of the "Enable Persistent Memory" epic, which focuses on providing users with transparency and access to their stored information.


### **Parent Epic:**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to remember key details about me and our past conversations across different sessions, so that our interactions feel more personal, continuous, and meaningful.**


### **User Story 4: User-Initiated Memory Review**

**As a user, I want to ask what Gemini-chan remembers about me, so I can review and verify my stored information.**


#### **Narrative:**

Trust is the foundation of a personal AI companion, and that trust is built on transparency. The user must feel in control and aware of what the AI knows about them. This story is about creating that essential transparency. A memory system that operates like an opaque "black box" can feel unsettling and undermine the user's confidence, making them hesitant to share personal information. By giving the user the ability to simply and conversationally ask, "What do you know about me?", we demystify the entire process and transform the dynamic from a one-sided data collection into a collaborative partnership.

This feature allows the user to see a clear, organized summary of the key facts and conversational highlights that Gemini-chan has stored. It's not just a raw data dump; it's a way for the user to get a snapshot of their own profile from the AI's perspective, allowing them to verify its accuracy. For instance, they can check if Gemini-chan correctly remembered their favorite hobby or the name of their pet. This builds immense confidence in the system, reinforces that the AI is truly listening, and provides a natural way for the user to see the foundation of the relationship they are building together. It empowers the user, making them an active participant in shaping their AI companion's understanding of them.


#### **Acceptance Criteria:**



1. **Given** that memories have been stored for my session, **when** I ask a direct question like, "What do you remember about me?", "Summarize my profile," or "Show me what you know," **then** the system must retrieve all associated memories (both individual facts and conversation summaries) from the vector store for my specific session.
2. **Given** the memories are retrieved, **then** Gemini-chan must synthesize them into a coherent, well-structured, and easy-to-understand natural-language summary. The presentation should be conversational and organized into clear categories like 'Personal Details' and 'Recent Topics' to improve readability.
    * "Here's what I know about you: Your name is Alex, and you enjoy hiking."
    * "Here are some highlights from our past conversations: We recently planned a trip to Japan, and you were excited about visiting Kyoto."
3. **Given** the summary is presented, **then** it must not expose any raw technical data. All backend information, such as confidence_scores, session_ids, vector embeddings, or raw timestamps, must be omitted. The output should be purely conversational and human-readable.
4. **Given** no memories have been stored for my session, **when** I ask what she remembers, **then** Gemini-chan must respond gracefully and encouragingly, stating that she hasn't stored any memories yet (e.g., "We're just getting to know each other, so I don't have any key memories saved just yet! I'm looking forward to learning more about you.").
5. **Given** that a large number of memories (e.g., more than 10) have been stored, **then** the summary must first present only the key themes or categories (e.g., 'About You', 'Our Recent Conversations') and then explicitly offer to provide more detail on a specific category if I ask.
