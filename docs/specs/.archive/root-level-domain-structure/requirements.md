# Feature: Root-Level Domain Structure

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the project's file structure to a domain-driven organization at the root level. The goal is to improve code organization, scalability, and maintainability by grouping files by their functional domain rather than by their file type. This change will involve moving all TypeScript source files from the `src` directory and the project root into a new, clearly defined directory structure.

## 2. Epics

### 2.1. Epic: File & Directory Scaffolding
This epic covers the creation of the new domain-based directory structure at the root level of the project.

### 2.2. Epic: Source Code Migration
#### 2.1.1. User Story: Create New Domain Directories
- **Priority**: High
- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to create the new domain-specific directories at the root of the project,
- **so that** I have a clear and organized structure for migrating the existing source code.

##### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: Verify new directories exist
  Given the project's root directory
  When I check the directory structure
  Then the following directories exist: `app`, `components`, `features`, `services`, `store`, `visuals`, `shared`, and `tests`.
```
This epic covers moving all existing TypeScript files from `src/` and the root directory into their corresponding new domain directories.

### 2.3. Epic: Configuration Updates
This epic covers updating all relevant configuration files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`) to reflect the new file paths and structure.

### 2.4. Epic: Dependency Resolution
This epic covers fixing all broken import paths and internal references within the moved files to ensure the application compiles and runs correctly after the refactor.
### 2.2.1. User Story: Relocate TypeScript Files
- **Priority**: High
- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to move all TypeScript files from the `src/` and root directories into the appropriate domain folders,
- **so that** the codebase is aligned with the new domain-driven structure.

##### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: Verify all TypeScript files are moved
  Given the new domain directory structure is in place
  When I inspect the project's root and `src/` directories
  Then there are no TypeScript files remaining in these locations.
```
### 2.3.1. User Story: Update Configuration Files
- **Priority**: High
- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to update all configuration files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`) to recognize the new root-level domain structure,
- **so that** the project builds correctly and the development environment is aware of the new file locations.

##### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: Verify build configuration is updated
  Given the source files have been moved to their new domain directories
  When I run the project's build command
  Then the build process completes successfully without any path-related errors.
```
### 2.4.1. User Story: Fix Broken Imports
- **Priority**: High
- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to update all internal import paths within the TypeScript files to reflect their new locations,
- **so that** the project's dependency tree is consistent and the application can be compiled without import-related errors.

##### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: Verify all internal imports are resolved
  Given all source files have been moved and configuration files have been updated
  When I run the TypeScript compiler
  Then the compilation process completes successfully without any "module not found" errors.
```
