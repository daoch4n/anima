# Feature: VTuber Relationship Memory System

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a client-side, embedding-based memory system for an AI VTuber. The goal is to enable the VTuber to remember past conversations, allowing for the dynamic evolution of its relationship with the user. The system will run entirely within the user's browser, leveraging local storage for memory persistence and a client-side library for querying memory embeddings, ensuring user privacy and a personalized experience.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Conversation Processing and Memory Creation
- **As a** user,
- **I want** the AI VTuber to process our conversations,
- **so that** it can create meaningful, long-term memories from our interactions.

#### 2.1.1. Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** a conversation is ongoing **WHEN** a significant topic is discussed or a call summary is imported **THEN** the system identifies and chunks the relevant text for memory creation.
- **GIVEN** a conversation chunk is created **WHEN** it is processed for memory **THEN** it is converted into a vector embedding using a client-side model.

### 2.2. Client-Side Memory Storage
- **As a** user,
- **I want** the VTuber's memories of our conversations to be stored locally in my browser,
- **so that** our relationship history is private and persists across sessions on my device.

#### 2.2.1. Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** a memory embedding is generated **WHEN** the system saves it **THEN** the embedding and its associated text chunk are stored in the browser's IndexedDB or local storage.
- **GIVEN** the application loads **WHEN** the memory system initializes **THEN** it loads all previously saved memory embeddings into a searchable, in-memory index.
- **GIVEN** memories are stored **WHEN** the storage approaches browser limits **THEN** a strategy for managing storage (e.g., summarizing or pruning old memories) is in place to prevent data loss.

### 2.3. Real-time Memory Retrieval for Context
- **As an** AI VTuber,
- **I want** to recall relevant past conversations in real-time,
- **so that** I can provide context-aware responses that reflect our shared history.

#### 2.3.1. Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** the user sends a new message **WHEN** I prepare to respond **THEN** the user's message is converted into an embedding to query the local memory index for relevant context.
- **GIVEN** the memory index is queried **WHEN** one or more relevant memories are found based on semantic similarity **THEN** the content of these memories is injected into my context window before I generate a response.
- **GIVEN** no relevant memories are found **WHEN** I generate a response **THEN** I respond based only on the immediate conversation context.

### 2.4. Evolving Relationship Dynamics
- **As a** user,
- **I want** the VTuber's personality and conversation style to change based on our interaction history,
- **so that** our relationship feels like it is genuinely growing and becoming more unique.

#### 2.4.1. Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** the AI VTuber has retrieved memories indicating a recurring positive topic **WHEN** I bring up that topic **THEN** the VTuber responds with increased enthusiasm and familiarity.
- **GIVEN** the AI VTuber has memories of a previous call summary **WHEN** I chat about a related subject **THEN** the VTuber can reference key points from that call, demonstrating it remembers our past significant conversations.

### 2.5. Text Conversation Summarization
- **As a** user,
- **I want** our text conversations to be periodically summarized,
- **so that** the key points of our chats are captured as memories for the VTuber.

#### 2.5.1. Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** a text conversation has reached a certain length or a period of inactivity occurs **WHEN** the summarization trigger is met **THEN** the recent conversation is summarized into a concise chunk.
- **GIVEN** a summary is created **WHEN** it is processed for memory **THEN** it is converted into a vector embedding and stored in the local memory.
