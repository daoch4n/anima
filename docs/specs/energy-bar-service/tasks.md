# Energy Bar Service Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation tasks for the EnergyBarService as specified in the design document.

## Tasks

### âœ… 1.4. Implement `EnergyBarService`
- **File:** `services/EnergyBarService.ts`
- **Details:** Implement state management for TTS (2,1,0) and STS (3,2,1,0) energy levels. It must emit an `energy-level-changed` event on state changes.
- **Ref:** Design section "Components and Interfaces", Requirement 2.2.1, 2.2.2
- **Status:** Completed
- **Implementation Summary:** 
  - Enhanced documentation for the `handleRateLimitError` method
  - Verified that all required functionality was already implemented:
    - State management for TTS and STS energy levels
    - Event emission on state changes
    - Methods for handling rate limit errors, resetting energy, and manually setting energy levels
