# User Story: Contextual Memory Retrieval

This document outlines the user story for the second phase of the "Enable Persistent Memory" epic, focusing on the active use of stored memories to create a more dynamic and personalized conversational experience.


### **Parent Epic:**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to remember key details about me and our past conversations across different sessions, so that our interactions feel more personal, continuous, and meaningful.**


### **User Story 2: Contextual Memory Retrieval**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to use her memory of our past conversations to inform her responses, so that our dialogue feels continuous and she seems more aware of our shared history.**


#### **Narrative:**

This story is about bringing Gemini-chan's memory to life. The goal is to evolve her from a stateless information source into a true conversational partner who builds a relationship over time. Currently, every interaction starts from scratch, which can make the user feel like they are talking to a machine with amnesia. The core of this story is to bridge the gap between sessions, allowing a relationship and a shared context to build over time. Itâ€™s not enough for Gemini-chan to simply store facts in a database; she needs to demonstrate that she's been paying attention by using that information at the right moment.

For example, if the user mentioned in a previous chat that their dog's name is "Buddy," and today they say, "I'm so tired, I had to take my dog to the park for hours," a stateless AI might give a generic response like, "That sounds tiring." But a memory-enabled Gemini-chan can ask, "Oh, that's great! Did Buddy have a good time chasing squirrels?" This proactive and context-aware recall is what elevates the interaction from a simple question-and-answer session into a genuine, flowing conversation. It makes the user feel heard, understood, and valued, proving that their past interactions have had a lasting and meaningful impact. This feature is the key to making the conversation feel like it's building on a shared history, which is the foundation of any real relationship.


#### **Acceptance Criteria:**



1. **Given** that Gemini-chan has a stored memory that my name is "Alex," **when** I ask a direct question like, "What is my name?" or "Do you know who I am?", **then** she must retrieve the correct information from her memory and answer conversationally, such as, "Of course, your name is Alex."
2. **Given** that Gemini-chan has a stored memory that I enjoy hiking, **when** I make an indirect, related statement like, "I had a great time in the mountains this weekend," **then** her response must be contextually enriched by that memory. For example, she should respond with something like, "That sounds wonderful! Did you get to go hiking on a new trail?" rather than a generic "That's nice."
3. **Given** I start a new conversation and mention a topic from a previous session (e.g., 'that project I was stuck on'), **then** Gemini-chan must demonstrate awareness of the previous discussion without me needing to re-explain the full context.
4. **Given** I am discussing a topic for which there are no relevant stored memories, **then** Gemini-chan's response must be natural and should not attempt to force an irrelevant memory into the conversation. For example, if I talk about a new movie I saw, she should not try to connect it to my hobby of hiking unless there is a logical reason to do so.
5. **Given** I have provided new information that contradicts an old memory (e.g., I previously said my favorite color was blue, but now I say it's green), **when** the new fact is stored, **then** any future responses related to my favorite color must reflect 'green' as the current truth.
