# User Story: User-Initiated Memory Deletion

This document outlines the user story for the fifth and final phase of the "Enable Persistent Memory" epic. This feature is essential for providing users with ultimate control over their personal data and is the cornerstone of building long-term trust.


### **Parent Epic:**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to remember key details about me and our past conversations across different sessions, so that our interactions feel more personal, continuous, and meaningful.**


### **User Story 5: User-Initiated Memory Deletion**

**As a user, I want to tell Gemini-chan to forget information, so that I have direct control over my personal data.**


#### **Narrative:**

Trust is the foundation of a personal AI companion. This story is about providing the ultimate tool for building that trust: a conversational 'off-switch.' The user must have the final say over what is remembered. Whether they want to remove an outdated fact or start completely fresh, this feature empowers them to manage their data through simple commands. It assures the user that their privacy and autonomy are the highest priority, transforming the memory system from a potentially invasive tool into a collaborative and respectful partnership.


#### **Acceptance Criteria:**



1. **Given** a memory about my hobby exists, **when** I say, 'Forget what I told you about hiking,' **then** the system must perform a similarity search with the phrase 'hiking' to find the most relevant memory and permanently delete it from the vector store.
2. **Given** I issue a global command to erase all memories (e.g., "Forget everything about me," "Clear your memory," "Let's start over from scratch"), **then** the system must permanently delete all stored memories and conversation summaries associated with my specific user session from the vector store.
3. **Given** I issue a global deletion command and Gemini-chan asks for confirmation, **when** I respond with a negative or ambiguous answer (e.g., 'no,' 'wait,' 'I'm not sure'), **then** the deletion process must be aborted, and Gemini-chan should confirm that no action has been taken.
4. **Given** a memory has been successfully deleted (either specific or global), **when** I later ask about that topic, **then** Gemini-chan must respond as if she never knew the information in the first place. For example, after deleting my name, if I ask "What is my name?", she should respond with something like, "I don't believe you've told me your name yet."
5. **Given** any deletion command, **when** the action is completed, **then** Gemini-chan must provide a specific confirmation. For a single deletion, she should say, 'Okay, I've forgotten that.' For a global deletion, she should say, 'Alright, all our past conversations have been cleared. It's nice to meet you!'
