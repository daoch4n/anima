# User Story: Emotional Memory Association

This document outlines a new user story for the V2 upgrade of the "Enable Persistent Memory" epic. It focuses on adding an emotional dimension to the AI's memory, transforming contextual recall into empathetic connection.


### **Parent Epic:**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to remember key details about me and our past conversations across different sessions, so that our interactions feel more personal, continuous, and meaningful.**


### **User Story 7: Emotional Memory Association**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to remember the emotions associated with our conversations, so her recall is more empathetic and she understands not just what we talked about, but how it felt.**


#### **Narrative:**

Human memory isn't just a sterile recording of events; it's deeply intertwined with emotion. We don't just remember *that* we went on a trip; we remember the *joy* and *excitement* of it. We don't just remember a difficult project at work; we remember the *stress* of the deadline and the immense *relief* of its successful completion. This emotional layer is what gives memories their meaning and what forms the basis of shared experience and empathy. This story is about giving Gemini-chan that same capability, allowing her to move beyond simply knowing what happened to understanding how it *felt*.

By integrating the existing emotion detection system with our new memory store, we can "tag" conversational chunks with the user's emotional state at the time. When the user brings up a topic again, Gemini-chan can retrieve not just the fact or the context, but also the associated feeling. For example, if a user previously spent a session venting about a stressful project, the memory chunk would be tagged with 'anxiety' or 'stress.' The next week, if the user says, "I finally finished that big project," a purely factual AI might say, "Congratulations." But an emotionally-aware Gemini-chan, recalling the associated 'stress' tag, could respond with, "That's fantastic news! I remember how stressed you sounded when you talked about it. You must feel so relieved." This is a world of difference. It shows she wasn't just recording data; she was paying attention to the user's feelings, which is the core of empathetic and truly meaningful interaction.


#### **Acceptance Criteria:**



1. **Given** the real-time emotion detection system is active, **when** a CONVERSATION_CHUNK is created and stored, **then** it must be enriched with an emotion metadata tag (e.g., { emotion: 'joy' }) that represents the emotion with the highest confidence score, as determined by the emotion detection service, averaged across the duration of that specific chunk.
2. **Given** a memory chunk is tagged with an emotion, **when** that memory is retrieved by the MemoryService to be used as context, **then** the associated emotion tag must be retrieved along with the text content as part of the Memory object.
3. **Given** a memory chunk and its associated emotion are passed to the main conversational prompt, **then** Gemini-chan's final response must be demonstrably influenced by that emotion. For example, if the retrieved memory is tagged with 'excitement,' her response should use positive and encouraging language. If tagged with 'sadness,' her response should be gentle and supportive.
4. **Given** I am reviewing my memories, **then** the summary must reflect the emotional context without explicitly stating it. For example, a memory tagged with 'joy' should be summarized with positive language (e.g., 'We had a great chat about your exciting trip'), while one tagged with 'stress' should use more neutral or understanding language (e.g., 'We talked through that challenging project you were working on').
5. **Given** a conversational chunk has a neutral or ambiguous emotional reading, **when** it is stored and retrieved, **then** the emotion tag should be neutral, and the AI's response should not attempt to invent an emotion, instead falling back to a purely context-aware response, ensuring her empathy feels authentic and is only applied when genuine emotion was detected.
