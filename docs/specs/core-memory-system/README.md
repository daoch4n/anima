### **User Story: Enable Persistent Memory for a Personalized Experience**

**As a user, I want Gemini-chan to remember key details about me and our past conversations across different sessions, so that our interactions feel more personal, continuous, and meaningful.**

---

#### **Narrative:**
The user wants to build a genuine connection with Gemini-chan. Currently, each conversation starts from a blank slate, which can feel impersonal and repetitive. By giving Gemini-chan a persistent memory, she can recall important information like the user's name, preferences (e.g., favorite color, hobbies), and significant topics from previous chats. This allows the conversation to evolve, building on past history and making the user feel truly seen and heard, transforming the experience from a simple Q&A to a genuine companionship.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Given** I have told Gemini-chan my name, **when** I start a new session, **then** she should be able to greet me by my name.
2.  **Given** I have shared a personal preference (e.g., "My favorite color is blue"), **when** I ask her about it in a later session, **then** she should be able to recall it correctly.
3.  **Given** we have discussed a specific topic before, **when** I reference it in a new conversation, **then** Gemini-chan should be able to retrieve the context and understand what I'm talking about without me re-explaining everything.
4.  **Given** I have had multiple conversations, **when** I ask for a summary of what she knows about me, **then** she should provide a coherent overview of the key facts she has stored.
5.  **Given** the memory system is active, **when** a conversation concludes, **then** a summary of the conversation is automatically created and stored in a vector database for future retrieval, as outlined in the design documentation.
