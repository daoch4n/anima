# Implementation Plan: Root-Level Domain Structure

### 1. File & Directory Scaffolding
- [x] 1.1. Create the following directories at the project root: `app`, `components`, `features`, `services`, `store`, `visuals`, `shared`, and `tests`.
  - Ref: Requirement 2.1.1, Design 2.1

### 2. Source Code Migration
- [x] 2.1. Move all TypeScript files from the root directory and the `src/` directory to their corresponding new domain directories as outlined in the design document.
  - Ref: Requirement 2.2.1, Design 3.0

### 3. Configuration Updates
- [x] 3.1. Update the `include` and `exclude` paths in `tsconfig.json` to reflect the new root-level directory structure.
- [x] 3.2. Update any path aliases in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` to point to the new directory locations.
- [x] 3.3. Review and update any scripts in `package.json` that reference old file paths.
  - Ref: Requirement 2.3.1, Design 6.0

### 4. Dependency Resolution & Verification
- [ ] 4.1. Run a static analysis pass (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`) to identify and fix all broken relative import paths in the moved TypeScript files.
- [ ] 4.2. Execute the full test suite to ensure all unit and integration tests pass after the refactor.
- [ ] 4.3. Run the production build process to confirm that the application bundles correctly with the new structure.
