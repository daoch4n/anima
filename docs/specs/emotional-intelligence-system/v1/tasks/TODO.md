# Quest Log: Forging the Emotional Soul (AEI v1)

This scroll contains the ordered tapestry of quests required to forge the Artificial Emotional Intelligence system, as designed by the Celestial Cartographer and illuminated by the Scryer of the Codeverse. Let the Great Sourceress walk this path with care and precision.

## Phase 1: The Speaking Soul - Emotion Interpretation

*   [x] **Quest 1: Heed the Oracle's True Voice.**
    *   **Task:** Absorb the Scryer's revelation and the Creator's guidance that emotion should be derived from the holistic context of the conversation, not just simple text tokens.
    *   **Outcome:** The grand design is re-aligned with a deeper, more nuanced reality.

*   [x] **Quest 2: Define the Stardust.**
    *   **Task:** Create the `EmotionEvent` interface in a shared types file (`shared/types.ts`).
    *   **Details:** The interface matches the blueprint: `emotion`, `intensity`, and `timestamp`.

*   [x] **Quest 3: Reforge the Vessel.**
    *   **Task:** Create the `EmotionService` to analyze the emotional tone of the conversation transcript.
    *   **Location:** `features/emotion/EmotionService.ts`
    *   **Details:** The service uses a powerful LLM (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) to distill the overall feeling from the dialogue history.

*   [x] **Quest 4: Grant the Vessel Understanding.**
    *   **Task:** Integrate the `EmotionService` into the core application logic.
    *   **Details:** The `GdmLiveAudio` component now periodically invokes the `EmotionService` to get the current emotion and stores it in the component's state.

## Phase 2: The Resonant Soul - Empathetic Response

*   [x] **Quest 5: Teach the Voice to Feel.**
    *   **Task:** This quest has been merged with Quest 6, as the primary expression is visual. The vocal modulation will be a future endeavor.
    *   **Outcome:** Focus is sharpened on the visual representation of emotion.

*   [x] **Quest 6: Grant the Body Expression.**
    *   **Task:** Enhance the `live2d-model` to change its expression based on the detected emotion.
    *   **Details:** The emotion state is passed down through `live2d-gate` and `live2d-visual` to `live2d-model`. A `switch` statement in the model's animation loop now applies specific parameter overrides for "joy," "sadness," "anger," and "surprise."

## Phase 3: The Grand Weaving - System Integration

*   [ ] **Quest 7: Weave the Threads Together.**
    *   **Task:** This quest is now complete, as the integration was performed as part of Quests 4 and 6.
    *   **Details:** The `EmotionService` is integrated, and its output is successfully piped to the Live2D model, completing the emotional feedback loop.

*   [ ] **Quest 8: The Trials of Harmony.**
    *   **Task:** Write a comprehensive suite of tests.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Unit tests for the `EmotionService` with various conversation transcripts.
        *   Integration tests to ensure the `live2d-model` reacts correctly to emotion property changes.
        *   An end-to-end test to verify that a sample conversation produces the expected visual response.

Let these quests guide your hand, Great Sourceress. Weave them well.
