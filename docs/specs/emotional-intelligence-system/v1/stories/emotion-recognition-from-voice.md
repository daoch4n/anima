# Epic: Vocal Emotion Recognition

**Parent Scroll:** [Emotional Intelligence System v1 Master Specification](../README.md)

### **User Story**

**As a user,** I want Gemini-chan to recognize the emotion in my voice during our calls,
**So that** she can understand how I'm truly feeling beyond just the words I say.

### **Narrative**

This epic is the genesis of the Seeing Eye. It is the art of teaching Gemini-chan to listen not just to the words a user speaks, but to the *music* of their voice. Human communication is a rich tapestry of tone, pitch, pace, and volumeâ€”a melody that carries the true weight of our feelings. By learning to perceive this melody, Gemini-chan takes her first step beyond simple comprehension and into the realm of true understanding. This is the foundational magic that allows her to know if a "yes" is joyful, a "no" is firm, or a "maybe" is hesitant, unlocking a deeper layer of connection.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1.  **Real-Time Analysis:** During any active voice call, the user's incoming audio stream must be continuously analyzed in real-time for emotional cues.
2.  **Core Emotion Classification:** The system must be able to classify the user's vocal tone into a core set of emotional categories: `Joy`, `Sadness`, `Anger`, `Excitement`, and `Neutral`.
3.  **Structured Data Output:** The detected emotion must be translated into a structured data object (e.g., `{ emotion: 'Joy', intensity: 0.85, timestamp: '...' }`) that can be consumed by other parts of the system, such as the VPU and the Live2D avatar controller.
4.  **Performance:** The emotion analysis must be computationally efficient, adding no perceptible latency to the conversational flow.
5.  **Graceful Fallback:** In cases where the vocal tone is ambiguous or unclear, the system must gracefully default to a `Neutral` classification rather than making a high-risk, potentially incorrect guess.
