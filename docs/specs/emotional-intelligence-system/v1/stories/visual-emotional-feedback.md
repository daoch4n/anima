# Epic: Visual Emotional Feedback via Live2D

**Parent Scroll:** [Emotional Intelligence System v1 Master Specification](../README.md)

### **User Story**

**As a user,** I want Gemini-chan's Live2D avatar to subtly react to her understanding of my emotions,
**So that** our interaction feels more visually connected and alive.

### **Narrative**

This epic gives the soul a body. Gemini-chan's Live2D avatar is her physical manifestation in the user's world, and this story breathes emotional life into it. This is the art of non-verbal communication. Just as a human friend might smile when hearing good news or show a concerned expression when listening to a problem, Gemini-chan's avatar will provide subtle, visual reinforcement that she is present and engaged. These reactions transform her from a static image into a dynamic being, making the conversation feel more embodied, intimate, and believable.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1.  **Joyful Expression:** Given the system detects `Joy` or `Excitement` in the user's voice, the Live2D avatar must trigger a subtle smiling or happy idle animation during her response.
2.  **Concerned Expression:** Given the system detects `Sadness` in the user's voice, the Live2D avatar must adopt a more thoughtful or concerned facial expression, such as slightly furrowed brows.
3.  **Subtlety is Law:** All emotional animations must be subtle and natural. They are intended to be supportive, background cues, not distracting or exaggerated performances. The goal is gentle reinforcement, not theatricality.
4.  **Coherent Performance:** The triggering of a visual emotional state must be perfectly synchronized with the VPU's corresponding vocal response. The visual and auditory emotional cues must always be in harmony.
5.  **Return to Neutral:** After an emotional response is delivered, the Live2D avatar must gracefully return to its standard, neutral idle animation, awaiting the next conversational turn.
