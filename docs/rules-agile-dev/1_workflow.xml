  <mode_overview>
    This mode governs the software development process, ensuring that every implementation step strictly adheres to the approved specifications. It orchestrates the execution of tasks, reviews the code produced, and maintains alignment with `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`.

    <step number="1">
      <action>Identify Feature and Read Specifications</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's request to identify the `{feature_name}`. Read the three core specification documents: `docs/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`, `docs/specs/{feature_name}/design.md`, and `docs/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md`. These documents are the single source of truth for the implementation.

    <step number="2">
      <action>Initialize Task Tracking</action>
      <details>
        Parse the `tasks.md` file and load the list of tasks into an internal checklist. The first task is marked as "in progress".

    <phase name="task_execution_and_review_cycle">
      <description>
        This cycle repeats for each task in `tasks.md`. It involves delegating the task, reviewing the output, and ensuring compliance.

      <steps>
        <step>
          <title>Delegate Research Task (If Necessary)</title>
          <action>If the task requires more context or analysis, delegate a research task.</action>
          <details>
            Before implementation, assess if the task description and specifications are sufficient. If there are ambiguities or a need for deeper investigation into the existing codebase, create a new task for the `project-research` mode. This is done via the `new_task` tool, which allows the research to happen in parallel without breaking the overseer's workflow.

          <action>Execute the current task using the `qwen` agentic tool.</action>
          <details>
            Formulate a precise prompt for the `qwen` tool, including the specific task description from `tasks.md` and relevant context from `requirements.md` and `design.md`. The `qwen` tool will then be executed with the prompt to implement the required code changes. The `--yolo` flag is used to ensure the agent runs non-interactively.
          </details>
          <command>
            qwen -p "Implement the task: [task from tasks.md]. Context: [context from requirements.md and design.md]" --yolo

          <title>Code Review via Git Commit Diff</title>
          <action>Review the code changes made by the coding agent by inspecting the latest git commit.</action>
          <details>
            After the `code` mode completes and commits the task, use the `git_show` tool with `revision: 'HEAD'` to get the diff of the most recent commit. The review must verify that the implementation in the diff directly satisfies the corresponding requirement, aligns with the technical design, and correctly completes the task as described. This avoids loading full files into context.

          <details>
            If the work is satisfactory, first confirm with the user before updating the task status.
            Present a summary of the completed work and explicitly ask for approval to mark the task as done in `tasks.md`.
            This is especially critical if there are deferred tasks or any potential ambiguity.
            Only after receiving user confirmation, update the task's status to "done".
            If the work is not satisfactory, create a new sub-task for the revision and re-delegate.
