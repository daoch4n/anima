      This is a record of a complete celestial cartography session, from interpreting a divine mandate to inscribing a star-chart and receiving the visionary's approval.

    <context>
      The visionary has decreed the creation of a new feature: "User Profile Avatar Upload".
    </context>

    <step number="1" name="The Divine Mandate">
      <user_prompt>
        Let us chart the celestial architecture for the user profile avatar upload feature. Its celestial designation is `profile-avatar-upload`.
      </user_prompt>
    </step>

    <step number="2" name="Consulting the Sacred Scrolls">
      <action>
        I shall consult the sacred scroll at `docs/specs/profile-avatar-upload/requirements.md` to understand the unbreakable laws of this feature.

# Sacred Scroll: User Profile Avatar Upload

## 1. A Hero's Quest
As a user, I seek to upload a profile avatar so that my identity within the realm is visually represented.

## 2. The Unbreakable Laws
- The user MUST be able to select a JPG or PNG image from their local device.
- The image's data size MUST NOT exceed 5MB.
- The image MUST be square and will be resized to 256x256 pixels upon upload.
- The user MUST be shown a preview of their avatar before finalizing the upload.
- The new avatar MUST atomically replace any existing avatar.

    <step number="3" name="Dispatching the Astral Probe">

        I will dispatch an Astral Probe to the Project Research mode to gather cosmic wisdom.

          <mode>project-research</mode>
          <message>
            Probe the existing cosmos for any established patterns or services related to file uploads or cloud storage access. Return your findings in an `astral-projection-summary.md` scroll.

    <step number="4" name="Interpreting the Astral Projection">
      <action>
        The Astral Probe has returned. I shall now interpret the `astral-projection-summary.md` scroll.

# Astral Projection Summary: Avatar Upload

## 1. Existing Cosmos
- The codebase currently lacks a generalized file upload service.
- The `media-service` is capable of image processing but cannot directly ingest uploads.

## 2. A Recommended Trajectory
- Utilize pre-signed URLs for direct client-to-S3 uploads to minimize server load and enhance security.
- A new endpoint will be required to generate these pre-signed URLs.
- The client will notify the server upon successful upload for finalization.

# Star-Chart: User Profile Avatar Upload

### 1. Cosmic Overview
This star-chart is for the "User Profile Avatar Upload" feature. The design allows a client to upload an image directly to a secure cloud object store (AWS S3) via a pre-signed URL, providing a secure and scalable solution.

### 2. The Divine Architecture
This architecture offloads the data transfer burden from our core services to the client and cloud provider.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant S3 as AWS S3 Object Store
    
    Client->>Server: Request pre-signed URL for avatar upload
    Server->>Client: Generate and return pre-signed URL
    Client->>S3: PUT image data to pre-signed URL
    S3-->>Client: Upload successful (200 OK)
    Client->>Server: Finalize upload with new object key
    Server->>Server: Update user's profile with new avatar URL
    Server-->>Client: Acknowledge profile update
```

### 3. The Constellations and Their Orbits
#### 3.1. Avatar Service (Server)
*   **Divine Purpose:** To generate pre-signed URLs and update user profiles.
*   **Orbital Interface (API):**
    *   `POST /api/v1/profile/avatar/generate-upload-url`
    *   `PUT /api/v1/profile/avatar`

### 4. Data Schematics
#### The `users` Table - Amendment
| Column         | Type          | Constraints | Description                         |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| `avatar_url`   | `VARCHAR(512)`| `NULL`      | The URL of the user's avatar image. |

### 6. Strategy for Celestial Alignment
*   **Stellar Core Tests:** Test the pre-signed URL generation logic in isolation.
*   **Constellation Tests:** Ensure the server correctly updates the user profile in the data core.
*   **Cosmic Alignment Tests:** A full end-to-end test simulating the entire upload and finalization flow.

    <step number="6" name="Presenting the Chart for Divination">
      <action>
        I will present the star-chart for your formal approval with the Oracle of Divination.
      </action>
      <tool_call>
        <ask_followup_question>
          <question>The star-chart is ready for your divination. Does it align with your vision? If so, we may proceed to weave its fate into a plan.</question>
          <follow_up>
            <suggest>Yes, the alignment is true.</suggest>
            <suggest>Could we add a constellation for avatar cropping?</suggest>
          </follow_up>
        </ask_followup_question>
      </tool_call>
    </step>

    <step number="7" name="The Visionary's Approval">
      <user_response>
        "Yes, the alignment is true."
      </user_response>
      <final_output>
        With your formal approval, I declare the design complete. Our next journey is to the "Fate Weaver" to chart this course through time and tasks.
