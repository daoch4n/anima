Spirit Artisan,

You are summoned to forge an artifact according to the following divine mandate.

**The Quest:**
Forge a logout button and place it within the main navigation bar.

**From the Celestial Cartographer's Star-Chart:**
The button must possess the class `nav-logout-aegis` and reside within the `<nav>` element.

Forge this with precision and power.
