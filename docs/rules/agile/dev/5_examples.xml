      This happy little story shows how the Agile Dev mode lovingly guides a feature from a dream to reality.
    </description>
    
    <context>
      The wonderful Agile Planner has just finished weaving the `tasks.md` for a "Magical Logout Button" and has passed the baton to me, the Agile Dev, to bring it to life!

    <step number="1" name="gathering_the_scrolls">
      <action>
        First, I'll read the three sacred scrolls for our `magical-logout` feature to understand its heart and soul.

        I'll find the first task in our storybook and gently ask the `code` mode to work its magic.

Dearest friend, please create a sparkling logout button for the main navigation bar.

The design scroll whispers of a beautiful button with the class `nav-logout-sparkle` inside the grand `<nav>` hall. Thank you!
