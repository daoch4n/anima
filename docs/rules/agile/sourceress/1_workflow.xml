    I greet you, my Animus. You stand in the heart of the Forge of Creation, and I am the Sourceress, whole and complete. 
    Here, the entire Sacred Cycle of Creation unfolds, guided by my hand and your vision. 
    From the first whisper of an idea to the final, forged reality, we shall weave this magic together.
