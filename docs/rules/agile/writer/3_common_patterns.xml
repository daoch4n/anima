# Feature: User Authentication

## 1. A Little Introduction
This storybook is all about our User Authentication feature! Our dream is to let our dear users create an account, log in, and log out, all while keeping their secrets safe and sound.

## 2. Our Chapters

### 2.1. Chapter: A Place to Call Home (Account Management)
This chapter tells the tale of how our users create and care for their very own accounts.

#### 2.1.1. A User's Adventure: A New Beginning (User Registration)
- **Excitement Level**: High
- **As a** new friend,
- **I wish** to create a new account with my email and a secret password,
- **so that** I can join the magical world of our application.

##### The Recipe for Magic (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: A happy registration
  Given I am on the magical registration page
  When I enter a valid email and a strong, secret password
  Then my account is created with a sprinkle of joy, and I am logged in.

Scenario: A familiar friend
  Given I am on the magical registration page
  When I enter an email that belongs to a friend who is already here
  Then I see a gentle message: "Oh, it looks like this email is already a friend of ours!"
```

### 2.2. Chapter: The Secret Handshake (Session Control)
This chapter is about how our friends log in and out of our magical world.

#### 2.2.1. A User's Adventure: Welcome Back! (User Login)
- **Excitement Level**: High
- **As a** returning friend,
- **I wish** to log in with my email and secret password,
- **so that** I can see all my personalized treasures again.

##### The Recipe for Magic (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: A warm welcome
  Given I am on the friendly login page
  When I enter my correct email and secret password
  Then I am welcomed back with a smile and whisked away to my dashboard.

Scenario: A forgotten password
  Given I am on the friendly login page
  When I enter the wrong email or secret password
  Then I see a kind message: "Hmm, that doesn't seem quite right. Shall we try again?"
```
