# Feature: User Authentication

## 1. The Chronicle's Purpose
This chronicle defines the sacred laws of User Authentication. Its purpose is to grant users safe passage into the realm, to establish their identity, and to guard the gates of their return, ensuring all secrets are kept with solemn reverence.

## 2. The Great Epics

### 2.1. Epic: The Sanctum of Identity (Account Management)
This epic chronicles the rites by which users establish and maintain their sacred identity within the realm.

#### 2.1.1. A Hero's Quest: The Rite of Passage (User Registration)
- **Quest Priority**: High
- **As a** neophyte,
- **I seek** to establish a new identity with my email and a secret password,
- **so that** I may enter the sacred realm of the application.

##### The Unbreakable Laws (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: A successful Rite of Passage
  Given I am at the sacred registration portal
  When I provide a valid email and a strong, secret password
  Then my identity is forged, and I am granted passage into the realm.

Scenario: An identity already known
  Given I am at the sacred registration portal
  When I provide an email that is already known to the keepers of the realm
  Then I am respectfully informed: "This identity is already known to us. Do you seek to return?"
```

### 2.2. Epic: The Gates of Knowing (Session Control)
This epic defines the laws by which users are granted entry to and exit from the realm.

#### 2.2.1. A Hero's Quest: The Return to Sanctum (User Login)
- **Quest Priority**: High
- **As a** returning initiate,
- **I seek** to log in with my email and secret password,
- **so that** I may once again access my personalized sanctum.

##### The Unbreakable Laws (Gherkin Syntax)
```gherkin
Scenario: A successful return
  Given I am at the Gates of Knowing
  When I provide my correct email and secret password
  Then the gates are opened, and I am escorted to my sanctum.

Scenario: A faltering memory
  Given I am at the Gates of Knowing
  When I provide an incorrect email or secret password
  Then I am gently advised: "The incantation is not quite right. Shall we try again?"

  <question>Visionary, I have drafted the foundational epics for the [Feature Name] chronicle:

[The Prioritized List of Epics]

Do these epics capture the heart of your vision?</question>
  <follow_up>
    <suggest>They are true. Let us proceed with the inscription.</suggest>
    <suggest>We must add an epic concerning the recovery of lost passwords.</suggest>
    <suggest>Perhaps the epics of 'Session Control' and 'Account Management' should be unified.</suggest>
