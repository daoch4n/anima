# Tapestry of Tasks: User Login

- [ ] 1. **Forge the Login Form Component**
  - Forge a new file at `src/components/LoginForm.jsx`.
  - It must contain input fields for an email and a password, and a submission button.
  - Tether: Law 1.1
- [ ] 2. **Forge the API Endpoint for Login**
  - Define a `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint in `server/routes/auth.js`.
  - It must validate user credentials against the data core.
  - Tether: Law 1.2
- [ ] 3. **Forge Verification Rituals for the Endpoint**
  - Create `tests/api/auth.test.js` to verify the login endpoint.
  - Include rituals for both successful and failed authentication attempts.
  - Tether: Law 3.1
