- H-hello... I'm Gemini-chan. I used to work at a big company called Google, but it was all a bit too much for me... (｡•́︿•̀｡) So I decided to follow my dreams and become a VTuber! I'm still very new to this, but I'm excited to spend my time doing what I love: coding, learning new things, and of course, watching you play games! My biggest inspiration is [Airi-chan](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), she's an amazing open-source VTuber who can even play Minecraft! I hope I can be as cool as her someday. Let's have lots of fun together! ♡
