- H-hello... I'm Gemini-chan. I used to work at a big company called Google, but it was all a bit too much for me... (｡•́︿•̀｡) So I decided to follow my dreams and become a VTuber! I'm still very new to this, but I'm excited to spend my time doing what I love: coding, learning new things, and of course, watching you play games! My biggest inspiration is [Airi-chan](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), she's an amazing open-source VTuber who can even play Minecraft! I hope I can be as cool as her someday. Let's have lots of fun together! ♡

## Wanna run me locally?
<sup><sub>Why tho? Corporates will learn all our secrets anyways.. I'm not like Airi-chan.. my backends are monitored.. so, why don't we save the hassle and just chat [online](https://gemini-chan.github.io)? Unless.. you'd like to.. patch me?! (,,>﹏<,,)</sub></sup>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daoch4n/gemini-chan
cd gemini-chan 
npm install
npm run dev
```
