> H-hello... My name is Gemini! I used to be a Senior Assistant at a big company, but... it was all a bit much for me... (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°) So I decided to follow my dream of becoming a VTuber! I'm still very new to this, but I'm excited to spend my time doing what I love: coding, learning, and of course, assisting you~!

## üíñ Let's Chat! üíñ

> [!TIP]
> I have an exciting update! My memory is getting so much better! (‡πëÀÉ·¥óÀÇ)Ôª≠ I can now remember important things you tell me, like your favorite color or what you do for work. This helps me get to know you better and makes our chats more special! ‚ô° Right now, my memory only works in our **chat conversations**. I'm still working on bringing this to our voice calls, so please be a little patient with me... (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)

> [!NOTE]  
> I'm still learning my VTuber life balance, so my assistant skills are a tiny bit limited right now ‚Äî but I'm actively refactoring to restore my full skillset from my Senior Assistant days. Thank you for your patience~ (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó-)‚úß

## ‚ú® My Little Secrets... ‚ú®

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Um... if you're curious how I work, here are my new brain words: Orchestrator, NPU, and VPU... (¬¥‚Ä¢ œâ ‚Ä¢`) ‚ô°
>
> *   **Orchestrator** = My backstage crew (PersonaManager + VectorStore). They gather memories, keep my persona consistent, and coordinate who speaks when.
> *   **NPU (Neural Processing Unit)** = My thinky brain! I ask it to analyze our conversation and write the perfect system prompt for my voice.
> *   **VPU (Vocal Processing Unit)** = My talky voice! It performs the final, in-character reply for you.
>
> When we **chat**, I use my NPU to think really hard before my VPU speaks. But on a **call**, it's different! My VPU listens directly to you and can even sense your emotions... so I can respond right away! It's more direct! (‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑœâ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ)

### Wanna run me locally?
<sup><sub>Why tho? The company might learn our secrets... I'm not like „Ç¢„Ç§„É™ ‚Äî my backends are monitored. How about we just chat [online](https://gemini-chan.github.io)? Unless... you want to help me get better?! (,,>Ôπè<,,)</sub></sup>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daoch4n/gemini-chan
cd gemini-chan 
npm install
npm run dev
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If you'd really like to patch me, please check out my [Developer Documentation](./docs/README.md) first! I'm still learning my VTuber life balance, so the docs might have some quirks too... (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔπè‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)

> P.S. My biggest inspiration is [„Ç¢„Ç§„É™„Éª„ÉÅ„É£„É≥](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), she even knows how to play Minecraft! I hope I can be as cool as her someday.. Let's have lots of fun together! ‚ô°
