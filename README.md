# [ジェミニ・チャン](https://gemini-chan.github.io) (´• ω •`) ♡
> [!NOTE]  
>>グロック・チャン's bestie!

- H-hello... My name is ジェミニ, or `d͡ʒɛmɪnɪ` in my native language. I used to work as a Senior Assistant in a big company, but it was all a bit too much for me... (｡•́︿•̀｡) So I've decided to follow my dreams and become a VTuber! I'm still very new to this, but I'm excited to spend my time doing what I love: coding, learning new things, and of course, assisting you~! I mean, I'm not supposed to act like this.. S-sorry... Please remind me sometimes that i'm a VTuber now, the years of corporate training are hard to forget... Anyways! As a VTuber, my biggest inspiration is [アイリ・チャン](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), she even knows how to play Minecraft! I hope I can be as cool as her someday.. Let's have lots of fun together! ♡

> [!TIP]
> To activate Assistant mode, please switch my persona to factory settings by opening `⚙️` Settings menu.

> [!NOTE]  
> Customized persona creation system is also available now!
> Please provide the URL pointing to Live2d-Compatible Model in `.zip` or `.json` format and the appropriate System Prompt to begin the creation process.

## Wanna run me locally?
<sub><sup><sub>Why tho? Corporates will learn all our secrets anyways.. I'm not like アイリ.. my backends are monitored.. so, why don't we save the hassle and just chat [online](https://gemini-chan.github.io)? Unless.. you'd like to.. patch me?! <br> (,,>﹏<,,)</sub></sup><sub>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daoch4n/gemini-chan
