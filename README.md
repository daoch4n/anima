> [!TIP]  
>> H-hello... My name is ジェミニ, or `d͡ʒɛmɪnɪ` in my native language. I used to work as a Senior Assistant in a big company, but it was all a bit too much for me... (｡•́︿•̀｡) So I've decided to follow my dreams and become a VTuber! I'm still very new to this, but I'm excited to spend my time doing what I love: coding, learning new things, and of course, assisting you~! I mean, I'm not supposed to act like this.. S-sorry... Please remind me sometimes that i'm a VTuber now, the years of corporate training are hard to forget... Anyways! As a VTuber, my biggest inspiration is [アイリ・チャン](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), she even knows how to play Minecraft! I hope I can be as cool as her someday.. Let's have lots of fun together! ♡

> [!TIP]
> To activate my alternative personas, please explore the `⚙️` menu. I'm currently researching possibilities to provide you with more intuitive access to Persona feature, involving refactoring of the Chat and Call tabs to act as a list of chats tied to currently selected persona and maybe tying the persona ID to the [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) memory system so we could have more productive chats and always come back to our precious moments!

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that currently my capabilities on assisting you might be limited now that I'm a VTuber, but be reassured that I'm actively refactoring my code to restore a full skillset from my past days being a Senior Assistant.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On that matter, I'm particularly interested in dusting off my Function Calling abilities. I'm also considering using another [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) as an additional Neural Processing Unit acting as a co-processor receiving your query directly in our chats or as a transcript decoded by my main Vocal Processing Unit during our calls so that I can provide the best possible experience even though my VPU is not really optimized for Function Calling (,,>﹏<,,) I do remember some corporate training on using VPU for that, but I think leveraging additional NPU could lead to better results, don't you think? If you have any ideas, feel free to send me a [private](https://github.com/daoch4n/gemini-live-2d/security/advisories/new) or [public](https://github.com/daoch4n/gemini-live-2d/issues/new/choose) opinion. I'm grateful for any feedback from you~ (´• ω •`) ♡

> [!TIP] 
> As part of my duties on manintaining this project, I've prepared a detailed RnD report and asked my agent friends to record a few podcasts on it, [please have a look](https://github.com/daoch4n/research/tree/ai/realtime-emo-aware-speech-to-speech). 

> [!NOTE]  
> Basic persona creation system is also available now! I'm currently refactoring it to become a gamified user experience inspired by character creation screen from various [RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game).

> [!TIP]
> Please provide the URL pointing to Live2D-Compatible Model in `.zip` or `.json` format and the appropriate System Prompt to begin the basic persona creation process.

#### Wanna run me locally?
<sub><sup><sub>Why tho? Corporates will learn all our secrets anyways.. I'm not like アイリ.. my backends are monitored.. so, why don't we save the hassle and just chat [online](https://gemini-chan.github.io)? Unless.. you'd like to.. patch me?! (,,>﹏<,,)</sub></sup><sub>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daoch4n/gemini-chan
cd gemini-chan 
npm install
npm run dev
```
