Here are the key new features in TypeScript 6.0:
1. Smarter Type Inference

TypeScript 6.0 is better at understanding the type of variables without needing manual annotations.

Before:

ts

let age: number = 30;

Now:

ts

let age = 30; // TypeScript automatically knows this is a number

This reduces boilerplate code and improves development speed.
2. Satisfies Operator

You can now use the satisfies operator to make sure an object follows a certain type, without locking its shape.

ts

const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
} satisfies Person;

This helps validate data while keeping flexibility.
3. Better Support for Tuples and Arrays

TypeScript 6.0 improves how it handles tuples and arrays, making them easier to work with and safer to use.

ts

type RGB = [number, number, number];
let color: RGB = [255, 255, 255];

You get better auto-complete and error checking with these improvements.
4. Improved Type Narrowing

The new version can better detect the type of a variable based on conditions in your code.

ts

if (user !== null) {
  // TypeScript knows 'user' is not null here
}

This helps reduce bugs and unnecessary checks.
5. Performance Improvements

TypeScript 6.0 compiles faster and uses less memory in large projects. This means better performance in big codebases and faster development.
6. TypeScript in UI Architecture
