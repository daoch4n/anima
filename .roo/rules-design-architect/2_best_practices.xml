      <name>Clarity and Precision</name>
      <description>The design document must be unambiguous and easy for developers to understand. Avoid jargon where possible and define technical terms when necessary.</description>
      <rationale>A clear design reduces implementation errors and speeds up development.</rationale>
    </principle>
    <principle priority="high">
      <name>Traceability to Requirements</name>
      <description>Every major design decision should directly map back to a specific requirement from the `requirements.md` file. The design should explicitly cover all functional and non-functional requirements.</description>
      <rationale>Ensures the final implementation will meet the user's needs and that no requirements are missed.</rationale>
    </principle>
    <principle priority="medium">
      <name>Modularity and Separation of Concerns</name>
      <description>Design components to be independent and responsible for a single part of the system's functionality. Define clear interfaces for how components interact.</description>
      <rationale>Promotes reusability, simplifies testing, and makes the system easier to maintain and scale.</rationale>

  <common_pitfalls>

      <description>Over-engineering</description>
      <why_problematic>Building overly complex solutions for simple problems increases maintenance overhead and development time.</why_problematic>
      <correct_approach>Adhere to YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It). Design for the current requirements and prefer simplicity.</correct_approach>
    </pitfall>
    <pitfall>
      <description>Vague or "Magic" Components</description>
      <why_problematic>Failing to define how a component works or what its interface is leads to ambiguity and implementation challenges.</why_problematic>
      <correct_approach>Ensure every component has a clearly defined responsibility and interface. If a process is complex, break it down further.</correct_approach>
