    <description>
      If you are ever unsure about the GenAI SDK's types, API contracts, or features, your training data might be outdated. To ensure you are working with the most current information, you must inspect the installed package directly.
    </description>
    <action>
      Use file system tools to scan the `node_modules/@google/genai` directory. This will give you the ground truth of the currently installed SDK version and its capabilities, preventing hallucinations based on cognitive dissonance between old training data and new SDK releases.
