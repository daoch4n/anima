# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a configurable debug logging system that allows developers to enable detailed logging during development while keeping production builds clean. The system will provide granular control over logging levels and can be toggled via environment variables or runtime configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enable debug logging during development, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand application behavior without affecting production performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL output detailed logging information to the console
2. WHEN debug mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL not output any debug logs to the console
3. WHEN the application is built for production THEN debug logging SHALL be automatically disabled by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enable debug logging for individual components separately, so that I can focus on specific components without being overwhelmed by logs from other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logging is configured THEN the system SHALL support enabling/disabling logging for individual components (e.g., 'transcript-auto-scroll', 'call-transcript', 'chat-view', 'live2d-visual')
2. WHEN a specific component's debug logging is enabled THEN only logs from that component SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN multiple components have debug logging enabled THEN logs from all enabled components SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN a component's debug logging is disabled THEN no logs from that component SHALL be displayed regardless of global debug settings
5. WHEN global debug is enabled but no specific components are configured THEN all components SHALL log debug information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure debug settings at runtime, so that I can enable/disable logging without rebuilding the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug configuration is changed via localStorage THEN the logging behavior SHALL update immediately
2. WHEN debug configuration is changed via URL parameters THEN the logging behavior SHALL update on page load
3. WHEN no debug configuration is found THEN the system SHALL fall back to environment variable settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debug logs to be clearly formatted and identifiable, so that I can quickly distinguish them from other console output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logs are output THEN they SHALL include a clear prefix indicating the component/category
2. WHEN debug logs are output THEN they SHALL include timestamp information
3. WHEN debug logs are output THEN they SHALL use consistent formatting across all components
4. WHEN debug logs are output THEN they SHALL support different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
