# Feature: Persona Management System

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a persona management system. The goal is to allow users to create, select, and manage different AI personas, each with its own distinct personality (system prompt), appearance (Live2D model), and memory. This system will serve as a central hub for the AI's identity, integrating with the settings menu, memory system, and model loading.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Persona Management in Settings
- **As a** user,
- **I want** to manage AI personas through a dedicated section in the settings menu,
- **so that** I can easily switch between different AI characters.

#### 2.1.1. Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** the settings menu is open **WHEN** I view the system prompt section **THEN** it is replaced by a new "Persona Management" section.
- **GIVEN** the "Persona Management" section is visible **THEN** it displays a list of available personas, with the currently active persona highlighted.
- **GIVEN** the list of personas is displayed **THEN** there is a default persona named "Gemini-chan".

### 2.2. Persona Creation and Configuration
- **As a** user,
- **I want** to create new personas and configure their attributes,

### 2.3. Persona Data Persistence
- **As a** user,
- **I want** my created personas to be saved,

### 2.4. System Integration
- **As a** user,
- **I want** the application to update dynamically when I switch personas,
- **so that** the AI's appearance, personality, and memory change accordingly.

#### 2.4.1. Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** I select a new persona from the list **WHEN** the selection is confirmed **THEN** the application's system prompt is updated to the selected persona's prompt.
- **GIVEN** I select a new persona **WHEN** the selection is confirmed **THEN** the Live2D model is updated to the URL associated with the selected persona.
- **GIVEN** I select a new persona **WHEN** the selection is confirmed **THEN** the `vtuber-memory-system` switches to the memory store associated with that persona.
- **GIVEN** I am interacting with the AI **THEN** all conversation history and memories are associated with the currently active persona.

### 2.5. Call Transcript Storage (Future)
