# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the current 3D sphere visualization with a Live2D avatar system for Gemini-chan. Live2D provides a simpler implementation path compared to full 3D VRM avatars while still delivering an engaging anime-style character experience. The system should maintain real-time audio responsiveness and provide a more character-focused visual experience.

## Requirements

Note: This document reflects current progress and decisions. Live2D integration is gated behind a fallback with the 3D sphere, with an emphasis on graceful failure and performance (lazy-loading and teardown). A Cubism Core autoload requirement has been added.

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a Live2D animated character instead of a 3D sphere, so that I have a more engaging and character-focused interaction experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a Live2D character model instead of the current 3D sphere
2. WHEN audio input is detected THEN the Live2D character SHALL respond with appropriate animations (mouth movement, eye blinks, etc.)
3. WHEN the AI is speaking THEN the Live2D character SHALL animate to show speaking behavior
4. WHEN there is no audio activity THEN the Live2D character SHALL display idle animations (eye blinks, saccades, subtle breathing)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simpler visualization system than full 3D VRM, so that the implementation is more maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Live2D system THEN it SHALL be less complex than a full VRM 3D avatar implementation
2. WHEN the Live2D system runs THEN it SHALL maintain good performance on standard web browsers
3. WHEN integrating Live2D THEN the system SHALL use established Live2D web libraries
4. IF future expansion is needed THEN the architecture SHALL allow for potential VRM 3D avatar integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Live2D character to respond to audio in real-time, so that the interaction feels natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I speak into the microphone THEN the character SHALL respond within 100ms with visual feedback
2. WHEN the AI responds with audio THEN the character's mouth movements SHALL sync with the speech
3. WHEN audio levels change THEN the character animations SHALL reflect the intensity appropriately
4. WHEN there are audio interruptions THEN the character SHALL handle transitions smoothly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Live2D character to have personality through basic animations, so that Gemini-chan feels more alive and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the character is idle THEN it SHALL display subtle breathing and blinking animations
2. WHEN the user starts speaking THEN the character SHALL show acknowledgment through eye movement or head tilts
3. WHEN audio input is detected THEN the character SHALL display attentive animations
4. WHEN the system is processing THEN the character SHALL show appropriate waiting animations

### Requirement 5

Note: Live2D uses the official Cubism 4 Core SDK. The application MUST ensure the core (live2dcubismcore.min.js + .wasm) is available globally before loading pixi-live2d-display/cubism4. This MUST be automated (no manual user steps).

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing audio processing pipeline, so that the Live2D integration doesn't break current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Live2D THEN the existing audio input/output processing SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN Live2D is active THEN the audio analysis data SHALL be available for character animation
3. WHEN switching visualization systems THEN the settings menu and API key management SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN Live2D fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior
