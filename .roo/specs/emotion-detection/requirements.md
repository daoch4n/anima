# Requirements Document - Emotion Detection

## Introduction

This feature involves adding emotion detection capabilities to Gemini-chan by analyzing conversation transcripts and applying appropriate facial expressions and animations to the Live2D character. This system would enhance the character's expressiveness by responding to emotional context in conversations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Live2D character to show appropriate emotions based on conversation context, so that interactions feel more natural and emotionally engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conversation contains positive sentiment THEN the character SHALL display happy or cheerful expressions
2. WHEN the conversation contains negative sentiment THEN the character SHALL show concerned or sympathetic expressions
3. WHEN the conversation is neutral THEN the character SHALL maintain a pleasant default expression
4. WHEN emotions change during conversation THEN the character SHALL transition smoothly between expressions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze conversation transcripts for emotional content, so that the system can determine appropriate character responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is processed THEN the system SHALL generate text transcripts of both user and AI speech
2. WHEN transcripts are available THEN the system SHALL analyze them for emotional indicators
3. WHEN emotional analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL map emotions to character expressions
4. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default expressions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want emotion detection to work in real-time, so that character expressions stay synchronized with the conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new speech is detected THEN emotion analysis SHALL complete within 2 seconds
2. WHEN emotions are detected THEN character expressions SHALL update within 500ms
3. WHEN multiple emotions are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize the strongest emotion
4. WHEN conversation pace is fast THEN the system SHALL handle rapid emotion changes gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use simple emotion detection methods, so that the implementation remains maintainable and doesn't require complex ML infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing emotion detection THEN the system SHALL use lightweight text analysis methods
2. WHEN analyzing text THEN the system MAY use keyword matching or simple sentiment analysis
3. WHEN more advanced analysis is needed THEN the system MAY integrate with external LLM APIs
4. WHEN emotion detection is disabled THEN the character SHALL continue to function with basic animations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want emotion detection to be optional, so that I can disable it if I prefer simpler character behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the user SHALL be able to enable/disable emotion detection
2. WHEN emotion detection is disabled THEN the character SHALL use only basic audio-responsive animations
3. WHEN emotion detection is enabled THEN the user SHALL see enhanced character expressiveness
4. WHEN switching modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without requiring app restart
