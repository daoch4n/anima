# Implementation Plan: Settings and API Key Management

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Priority**
Implement the settings menu and API key management functionality.

**Related Specs:**
- [Persona System Tasks](../persona-system/tasks.md) - Builds upon the settings menu foundation implemented here to add persona management capabilities

- [x] 1. Implement Settings Menu UI: Create the `settings-menu.ts` component with an API key input field, validation, and paste/get key buttons.
  - Requirements: 2.3.1, 2.4.1, 2.5.1

- [x] 2. Implement API Key Validation and Persistence: Add logic to validate the API key format and save it to local storage upon successful validation.
  - Requirements: 2.4.1, 2.5.1

- [x] 3. Implement On-Demand Settings and Toast: In the main application, trigger the settings menu and a toast notification when an action requires a missing API key.
  - Requirements: 2.2.1

- [x] 4. Testing: Write unit and integration tests for all new functionality.
  - Sub-tasks:
    - [x] 4.1. Test API key validation and persistence.
    - [x] 4.2. Test the on-demand settings menu and toast notifications.
    - [x] 4.3. Test that the settings menu is hidden during active calls.

- [x] 5. Implement Dynamic API Key Management: Add real-time validation, auto-save, and client reinitialization for API key changes.
  - Add `api-key-changed` event emission for runtime client updates
  - Update main application to handle `api-key-changed` events with client reinitialization
  - Add toast notifications for successful API key updates and validation errors
  - Implement smart change detection to avoid unnecessary reinitializations
  - Requirements: 2.6.1, 2.7.1

- [x] 6. Fix API Key Clearing Behavior: Ensure clearing the API key field shows validation error and preserves existing key in storage.
  - Update validation logic to show error for empty API key input
  - Ensure auto-save skips empty values and preserves existing key in localStorage
  - Requirements: 2.6.1, 2.7.1

- [ ] 7. DEFERRED: Add dedicated tests for dynamic API key management and real-time validation functionality.
- [x] 8. Refactor Design Specification: Restructure the design.md document to accurately reflect the settings menu's implemented layout, including the addition of theme, animation, and system prompt sections, and reorder them to match the UI flow.
- [x] 9. Implement Settings Menu Layout Refactoring: Update the `settings-menu.ts` component to reorder the settings sections, positioning the "System Prompt" section between the "UI" and "Live2D Model URL" sections to align with the updated design.
